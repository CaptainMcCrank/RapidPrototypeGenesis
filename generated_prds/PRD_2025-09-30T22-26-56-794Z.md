## The Soul of the Product

### 1. The One-Liner
*In 10 words or less, what does this thing DO?*

**Answer:** A Wifi hacking lab with beautiful LEDs that show competitor progress.


### 2. The Emotional Hook
*What feeling should users have in the first 10 seconds of interaction?*

**Answer:** Excitement and empowerment.  A feeling of accomplishment and wonder because they're able to do something hard that not many people know how to do.  They're a HACKER!


### 3. The 'Holy Shit' Moment
*What's the ONE feature that makes someone text their friend about this?*

**Answer:** The ability for anyone to run an at-home hacking lab that kids can learn powerful and valuable computer skills on.

### 4. The Non-Negotiable
*What's the single quality that, if compromised, kills the entire product?*

**Answer:** Cool LED status bars that signal process & advanced tech.  Beautiful web pages that provide thematic support in the hacker's journey.

## The Beautiful Constraint

### 5. Primary Interface
*What's the MAIN way users interact? (touch/voice/gesture/CLI/web/physical)*

**Answer:** Primarily through a CLI on their computer- but also through web apps vended from the pi.  The LED hat should be doing exciting things throughout the event.

### 6. The 80% Use Case
*What will 80% of users do 80% of the time?*

**Answer:** Attempt to connect to the wifi network.  Hopefully most will successfully gain access to the network.  

### 7. The Deletion Test
*If you could only ship THREE features, which three?*

**Answer:** Wifi network, vulnerable web app, LED status hat

### 8. The Grandma Test
*Can you explain this to a grandma in one sentence? (If no, simplify)*

**Answer:** It's a techno junglegym for kids to learn hacking

## User Journey Crystallization

### 9. First Touch
*Describe the EXACT first 60 seconds of user experience (every tap, every screen)*

**Answer:** The participant will scan for the wifi network to target.
The participant might scan for an existing active connection that could be targeted for sniffing a 4 way handshake and password cracking.  Some users will have to default to password guessing techniques.  

When they gain access to the network, they'll perform a network scan to find IP addresses to target. Then they'll scan for listening network services.  They'll see an SSH port and a web server.  The web server will vend a primary web page with a registration button.  The user will be guided to register- they cannot proceed without registering.  After the user registers, the web page will vend 3 pages- A CTF Leaderboard that shows their and their competitors progress, a static web page with tips and tutorials and a vulnerable web application they'll be targeting for compromise.   

### 10. The Learning Cliff
*What does the user need to know BEFORE they start? (aim for: nothing)*

**Answer:** They'll need to have a computer.  They'll need to have admin access to the computer in case they need to install software.  

### 11. The Payoff Timeline
*How long until they get value? (Target: <2 minutes)*

**Answer:** They should get value immediately from the puzzle-solving experiences.  

### 12. The Daily Ritual
*Why would someone use this tomorrow? And next week?*

**Answer:** It's an awesome, real world way to learn hacking.  They can use this system to start learning linux and eventually get a career in technology, networking and software development.  

## Technical Beauty Standards

### 13. Response Religion
*Maximum acceptable latency for primary action? (OP-1: instant, Tesla: <100ms)*

**Answer:** <20 ms.

### 14. Failure Grace
*When things break, what's the user experience? (Don't say 'it won't break')*

**Answer:** The user will be given clear notifications on when a CTF manager should take a look at the system to fix something that's broken on the system.  

If the user is failing to succeed at hacking, they should be guided towards tutorials that help them on the problem they're stuck on.

### 15. The Ambient State
*What does it look/do when nobody's using it?*

**Answer:** A cool flashing LED inspiring you to investigate the device. 

### 16. Physical Presence
*Any physical indicators/feedback? (LEDs, sounds, haptics, display)*

**Answer:** LEDs on the pi hat of the device. 

## System Architecture Lightning Round

### 17. Hardware Stack
*List every physical component needed (be exhaustive)*

**Answer:** Raspberry Pi 5
Raspberry pi sense hat

### 18. Software Services
*List every daemon/service/process that must run*

**Answer:** dnsmasq
hostapd
a webserver
A flask app for vending a vulnerable web application
docker?
A custom app or series of apps for managing the SenseHat, monitoring logs and updating the progress state for individual ctf Competitors
Perhaps an instance of CTFD?  
wazuh or ossec
maybe zeek or sentry?


### 19. Network Topology
*Draw the network in words (who talks to what, how)*

**Answer:** The network topology will be a star, with the center node being the raspberry pi vending the network & hosting services.  The other nodes will be clients attaching to the network. 

### 20. Data Flows
*What information moves where? (user input → processing → output)*

**Answer:** Packets will flow bidirectionally between the clients and the wifi hotspot. 

There will be some interaction between system services so that the successful injection of a script attack against the flask app is discovered & indicated in the CTF status page and on the pi sense hat.  There may be interactions between bro and the CTF status apps to indicate additional progress on the hacking challenges. 



## State & Persistence

### 21. State Management
*What needs to be remembered between sessions?*

**Answer:** We need to know the relationship between the participant name and the mac address of their device.  We also need to know what Mac address is associated with the IP address when an app like a web server logs ip address requests.  We also need to track their progress on the challenges.  We need to know which tasks they've completed to properly show the status on the PI Sense Hat.  We also need to know what column is associated with that user and ensure it stays consistent.

We need to have some kind of cookie solution for ensuring that the web app vends information associated with the correct participant handle + Mac Address + Ip address

### 22. Reset Behavior
*What happens after power cycle?*

**Answer:** The system should resume in it's previous state.  We should show the participant's observed progress.  Resetting of the Sense hat LEDs and the CTF leaderboard should only be activated by an Admin through a authenticated and privileged command. 

### 23. Multi-User Reality
*Can multiple people use simultaneously? How?*

**Answer:** Multiple clients can be attached to the wifi network simultaneously.  This is because the solution supports multiple clients. 

### 24. Progress Indicators
*How does the system show what's happening? (visual/audio/network)*

**Answer:** The system will show what's happening through at least 4 possible approaches:

1) The Sense HAT LEDs
2) The CTF Leaderboard page
3) Parsing of log files on the system
4) Privileged system commands run through SSH by the CTF Manager. 

## Concrete Deliverables

### 25. File System Layout
*Where does everything live? (/etc/, /var/, /opt/, etc.)*

**Answer:** The system will use a standard Linux filesystem.  The solution will deploy open source solutions like Hostapd or lighttpd or nginx in traditional linux filesystem locations.  Custom project code and applications for monitoring progress & updating leaderboards should be deployed in /opt

### 26. Configuration Baseline
*List every config file and its primary purpose*

**Answer:** /etc/hostapd.conf should be used for managing the Wifi network configuration & implementation

/etc/dnsmasq.conf should be used for managing ip address assignment and dns lookups.

The agents later in the project can work out the rest of the configuration baselines, as the implementation decisions will be left up to the agents. 

### 27. Security Posture
*Default passwords? Open ports? Intentional vulnerabilities?*

**Answer:** default ssh pi password: ChangeDefaultPWD3331333
Web server running on ports 443 and 80.  Dnsmasq will be available on standard ports.  

The default wifi password should be supervisor


### 28. Testing Victory
*How do you know it works? (specific, measurable outcomes)*

**Answer:** Web Page correctly increments progress status for each participant. 

SenseHAT correctly increments progress status for each participant.

Vulnerabilities are exploitable and users are able to successfully exploit them.  This should be demonstrated by successful shell access, successful program execution and log entries with indicators of compromise.  Custom flask app should implement logging that gives us signals when participants are successfully submitting working exploits. 

## Automation Prerequisites

### 29. Environment Variables
*What must be configurable?*

**Answer:** Wifi password should be changeable.  

### 30. Bootstrap Sequence
*Order of operations from blank Pi to working product?*

**Answer:** Installing of required components and dependencies.
Tuning of components and dependencies that produces expected experiences.
Development & Installation of applications that handle things like monitoring the endpoints/logs for indicators of compromise & updating the CTF leaderboard & sensehat leds. 
Unit & System Integration tests successfully validate that the required services run and are proven to be exploitable, with corresponding updates to CTF Leaderboard & Pi Sense LEDs

### 31. Dependency Chain
*What must exist before what? (network before services, etc.)*

**Answer:** Pi needs to successfully boot & load necessary services.
Hostapd Needs to come online and vend the network with the correct config.
Dnsmasq needs to come online and vend dhcp addresses to attaching devices using the correct config
Web servers need to come online and vend the registration page, ctf leaderboard, tutorials and vulnerable web app. 

### 32. Health Checks
*How does the system verify it's working correctly?*

**Answer:** System should perform periodic tests to validate that all required services are online and vending correctly.  This could be through systemd timers or cron jobs.  All critical services should be tested for accessibility and errors. 

## The Polish That Matters

### 33. The Delight Detail
*One small thing that's unnecessarily perfect (OP-1's knobs, iPhone's rubber-band scroll)*

**Answer:** The LED display needs to be both informative about play state, but flashy as well.  It should show periodic interstitial images or cool animations that make the lab feel exciting.  

Web pages need to have cool hacker themes.  Would be wonderful to have a cool chiptune streaming server that plays cool open source hacking music to anyone who wants to connect to it and stream the audio. 

### 34. The Power User Secret
*One hidden feature for advanced users to discover*

**Answer:** The ability to deface the CTF page and put a picture that the user controls which shows total ownership of the system.  Think of it like cool graffiti.  The hook should be it's not just the image. but maybe rendered in cool ascii art.  The user shouldn't have to generate the art- maybe there's a secret page that they can use to upload a photo and then it will modify the CTF background to reflect the cool ascii art in a low opacity font that doesn't disrupt the page too much.  

### 35. The Personality Tell
*How does this product's personality show? (error messages, waiting states, success celebrations)*

**Answer:** The product's personality should show via error messages and success celebrations.

If they're wandring into parts of the app that don't exist and have no exploitable errors, the 404 pages should initially be pretty generic and gradually become more and more petty.  "You're losing focus!  You've got to LOCK IN!"  "ICE COLD!  SOO VERY COLD.  YOU NEED TO GET WARM!"  

When someone succeeds at a challenge, it might be cool to have a multicolor explosion show up on the full Sense Hat before returning to the status bars.  

### 36. The Unboxing
*First boot experience - what happens when it powers on fresh?*

**Answer:** Device powers up.  Led's scroll a red message notifying the CTF admin to complete initial setup.  The admin will log into an admin page and click on a "activate CTF" button that will ensure that all appropriate systems are reset to zero and to begin monitoring for new participants.  

## The Reality Check

### 37. The Minimum Lovable
*Below what threshold does this become unusable/unlovable?*

**Answer:** No visual indication of successful compromise.  No logging of individual users progress in an automated fashion.  

### 38. The Expansion Hook
*What's the OBVIOUS next feature you're intentionally NOT building now?*

**Answer:** Exploiting a listening service using memory corruption.  More advanced web hacking.  

### 39. The Success Metric
*ONE number that tells you if this worked*

**Answer:** 1 winner out of 5 concurrent participants is able to successfully complete all challenges, with corresponding visual updates on the CTF Leaderboard & Pi Sense hat. 

### 40. The Kill Switch
*How does someone gracefully stop/reset everything?*

**Answer:** The admin should be able to log into the system and pause progress logging.  The admin should be able to resume progress logging.  The admin should be able to "reset" the system, which would leave a progress log that indicates everyone's completion state, then purge all participants, reset the monitoring metrics & start a new CTF
