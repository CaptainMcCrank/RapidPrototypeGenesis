    "0": "A Wifi hacking lab with beautiful LEDs that show competitor progress.\n",
    "1": "Excitement and empowerment.  A feeling of accomplishment and wonder because they're able to do something hard that not many people know how to do.  They're a HACKER!\n",
    "2": "The ability for anyone to run an at-home hacking lab that kids can learn powerful and valuable computer skills on.",
    "3": "Cool LED status bars that signal process & advanced tech.  Beautiful web pages that provide thematic support in the hacker's journey.",
    "4": "Primarily through a CLI on their computer- but also through web apps vended from the pi.  The LED hat should be doing exciting things throughout the event.",
    "5": "Attempt to connect to the wifi network.  Hopefully most will successfully gain access to the network.  ",
    "6": "Wifi network, vulnerable web app, LED status hat",
    "7": "It's a techno junglegym for kids to learn hacking",
    "8": "The participant will scan for the wifi network to target.\nThe participant might scan for an existing active connection that could be targeted for sniffing a 4 way handshake and password cracking.  Some users will have to default to password guessing techniques.  \n\nWhen they gain access to the network, they'll perform a network scan to find IP addresses to target. Then they'll scan for listening network services.  They'll see an SSH port and a web server.  The web server will vend a primary web page with a registration button.  The user will be guided to register- they cannot proceed without registering.  After the user registers, the web page will vend 3 pages- A CTF Leaderboard that shows their and their competitors progress, a static web page with tips and tutorials and a vulnerable web application they'll be targeting for compromise.

    "9": "They'll need to have a computer.  They'll need to have admin access to the computer in case they need to install software.  ",
    "10": "They should get value immediately from the puzzle-solving experiences.  ",
    "11": "It's an awesome, real world way to learn hacking.  They can use this system to start learning linux and eventually get a career in technology, networking and software development.  ",
    "12": "<20 ms.",
    "13": "The user will be given clear notifications on when a CTF manager should take a look at the system to fix something that's broken on the system.  \n\nIf the user is failing to succeed at hacking, they should be guided towards tutorials that help them on the problem they're stuck on.",
    "14": "A cool flashing LED inspiring you to investigate the device. ",
    "15": "LEDs on the pi hat of the device. ",
    "16": "Raspberry Pi 5\nRaspberry pi sense hat",
    "17": "dnsmasq\nhostapd\na webserver\nA flask app for vending a vulnerable web application\ndocker?\nA custom app or series of apps for managing the SenseHat, monitoring logs and updating the progress state for individual ctf Competitors\nPerhaps an instance of CTFD?  \nwazuh or ossec\nmaybe zeek or sentry?\n",
    "18": "The network topology will be a star, with the center node being the raspberry pi vending the network & hosting services.  The other nodes will be clients attaching to the network. ",
    "19": "Packets will flow bidirectionally between the clients and the wifi hotspot. \n\nThere will be some interaction between system services so that the successful injection of a script attack against the flask app is discovered & indicated in the CTF status page and on the pi sense hat.  There may be interactions between bro and the CTF status apps to indicate additional progress on the hacking challenges. \n\n",
    "20": "We need to know the relationship between the participant name and the mac address of their device.  We also need to know what Mac address is associated with the IP address when an app like a web server logs ip address requests.  We also need to track their progress on the challenges.  We need to know which tasks they've completed to properly show the status on the PI Sense Hat.  We also need to know what column is associated with that user and ensure it stays consistent.\n\nWe need to have some kind of cookie solution for ensuring that the web app vends information associated with the correct participant handle + Mac Address + Ip address",
    "21": "The system should resume in it's previous state.  We should show the participant's observed progress.  Resetting of the Sense hat LEDs and the CTF leaderboard should only be activated by an Admin through a authenticated and privileged command. ",
    "22": "Multiple clients can be attached to the wifi network simultaneously.  This is because the solution supports multiple clients. ",
    "23": "The system will show what's happening through at least 4 possible approaches:\n\n1) The Sense HAT LEDs\n2) The CTF Leaderboard page\n3) Parsing of log files on the system\n4) Privileged system commands run through SSH by the CTF Manager. ",
    "24": "The system will use a standard Linux filesystem.  The solution will deploy open source solutions like Hostapd or lighttpd or nginx in traditional linux filesystem locations.  Custom project code and applications for monitoring progress & updating leaderboards should be deployed in /opt",
    "25": "/etc/hostapd.conf should be used for managing the Wifi network configuration & implementation\n\n/etc/dnsmasq.conf should be used for managing ip address assignment and dns lookups.\n\nThe agents later in the project can work out the rest of the configuration baselines, as the implementation decisions will be left up to the agents.

    "26": "default ssh pi password: ChangeDefaultPWD3331333\nWeb server running on ports 443 and 80.  Dnsmasq will be available on standard ports.  \n\nThe default wifi password should be supervisor\n",
    "27": "Web Page correctly increments progress status for each participant. \n\nSenseHAT correctly increments progress status for each participant.\n\nVulnerabilities are exploitable and users are able to successfully exploit them.  This should be demonstrated by successful shell access, successful program execution and log entries with indicators of compromise.  Custom flask app should implement logging that gives us signals when participants are successfully submitting working exploits. ",
    "28": "Wifi password should be changeable.  ",
    "29": "Installing of required components and dependencies.\nTuning of components and dependencies that produces expected experiences.\nDevelopment & Installation of applications that handle things like monitoring the endpoints/logs for indicators of compromise & updating the CTF leaderboard & sensehat leds. \nUnit & System Integration tests successfully validate that the required services run and are proven to be exploitable, with corresponding updates to CTF Leaderboard & Pi Sense LEDs",
    "30": "Pi needs to successfully boot & load necessary services.\nHostapd Needs to come online and vend the network with the correct config.\nDnsmasq needs to come online and vend dhcp addresses to attaching devices using the correct config\nWeb servers need to come online and vend the registration page, ctf leaderboard, tutorials and vulnerable web app. ",
    "31": "System should perform periodic tests to validate that all required services are online and vending correctly.  This could be through systemd timers or cron jobs.  All critical services should be tested for accessibility and errors. ",
    "32": "The LED display needs to be both informative about play state, but flashy as well.  It should show periodic interstitial images or cool animations that make the lab feel exciting.  \n\nWeb pages need to have cool hacker themes.  Would be wonderful to have a cool chiptune streaming server that plays cool open source hacking music to anyone who wants to connect to it and stream the audio. ",
    "33": "The ability to deface the CTF page and put a picture that the user controls which shows total ownership of the system.  Think of it like cool graffiti.  The hook should be it's not just the image. but maybe rendered in cool ascii art.  The user shouldn't have to generate the art- maybe there's a secret page that they can use to upload a photo and then it will modify the CTF background to reflect the cool ascii art in a low opacity font that doesn't disrupt the page too much.  ",
    "34": "The product's personality should show via error messages and success celebrations.\n\nIf they're wandring into parts of the app that don't exist and have no exploitable errors, the 404 pages should initially be pretty generic and gradually become more and more petty.  \"You're losing focus!  You've got to LOCK IN!\"  \"ICE COLD!  SOO VERY COLD.  YOU NEED TO GET WARM!\"  \n\nWhen someone succeeds at a challenge, it might be cool to have a multicolor explosion show up on the full Sense Hat before returning to the status bars.  ",
    "35": "Device powers up.  Led's scroll a red message notifying the CTF admin to complete initial setup.  The admin will log into an admin page and click on a \"activate CTF\" button that will ensure that all appropriate systems are reset to zero and to begin monitoring for new participants.  ",
    "36": "No visual indication of successful compromise.  No logging of individual users progress in an automated fashion.  ",
    "37": "Exploiting a listening service using memory corruption.  More advanced web hacking.  ",
    "38": "1 winner out of 5 concurrent participants is able to successfully complete all challenges, with corresponding visual updates on the CTF Leaderboard & Pi Sense hat. ",
    "39": "The admin should be able to log into the system and pause progress logging.  The admin should be able to resume progress logging.  The admin should be able to \"reset\" the system, which would leave a progress log that indicates everyone's completion state, then purge all participants, reset the monitoring metrics & start a new CTF "
